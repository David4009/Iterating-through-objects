function getTokens(rawString) {  
return rawString.toLowerCase().split(/[ ,!.";:-]+/).filter(Boolean).sort();
}
answer: This is a return. It requests all text to lowercase. The split() method is used to split the string into an array of 
  substrings, and returns the new array based on different separators listed in the parenthesis of the split() function,
  It removes any falsy items like null, false, '', etc from the string, The filter() method creates an array filled with all 
  array elements that pass a test (provided as a function). Sort is used to sort the array in ascending order. After this it 
  returns the object of substrings.
  
function mostFrequentWord(text) {
answer: This is a function that finds the most frequent word in the text, thus the name mostFrequentWord. It accepts a single 
  parameter, text, and returns the most frequent word per the parameter: text.

let words = getTokens(text);
answer: let words is a variable that creates an object of words by calling the getTokens() function. a text argument will be 
  passed to the getTokens() function
  
let wordFrequencies = {};
answer: this section indicates an empty array of objects. The object will hold the words as keys and their frequencies as their 
values.

for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
answer: This is a For Loop. It starts at 0 and goes until the total count of the words. 

if (words[i] in wordFrequencies) {
answer: This IF statement checks if the word string exists in the wordFrequencies object.

wordFrequencies[words[i]]++;
answer: if it exists add 1 to the frequency of the word.

} else {
answer: if not or otherwise.
 
wordFrequencies[words[i]] = 1;
    }
  }
answer: give a frquency of 1 to the word.

let currentMaxKey = Object.keys(wordFrequencies)[0];
answer: This code declares a variable that holds the first keyword of the wordFrequencies object.

let currentMaxCount = wordFrequencies[currentMaxKey];
answer: This code declares a variable that will hold the value frequency of the first word initialized.

for (let word in wordFrequencies) {
answer: This For Loop loops through the wordFrequencies object which holds words as keys and frequencies as values

if (wordFrequencies[word] > currentMaxCount) {
answer: check each word or key in the wordFrequencies object and compare the them.
    if the frequency of the current word is greater than the frequency of the first word...
    
currentMaxKey = word;
answer: upate the word with maximum frequency to current word and...

currentMaxCount = wordFrequencies[word];
    }
  }
answer: update currentMaxCount by the current frequency 

return currentMaxKey;
}
answer: returns the word with the appears the most among the text.
